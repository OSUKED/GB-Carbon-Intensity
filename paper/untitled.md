### Introduction

* Why are current carbon intensity estimates not good enough?
    * They're a function of n_startups, load_factor, age, capacity - not just the fuel-type
* What is the high-level approach for calculating carbon intensity
    * Should mention Mirko's work here
* Explain what we're doing, including: 
    * Linking output to both the ETS and GB Pollution Inventory
    * Disaggregation back into fuel types (by fitting carbon intensity estimates to the function)
    * Half-hourly carbon intensity (of generation) at a site, regional, and national level
* Discuss how this is a use-case of the data dictionary, as well as how the frictionless datasets enable this to be automated and expanded going forward

* Could include a statistical properties section ...?
* ^ One way to do this would be to motivate it for estimating the asset level carbon intensities
